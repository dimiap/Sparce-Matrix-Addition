# Sparce-Matrix-Addition
Sparce Matrix Addition using linked lists


The program begins with the user being asked to insert the dimensions of the matrixes he wants to create. We know that in matrix addition the two matrixes must have the same dimensions. After, the system asks for the user to input the row column and value of non zero items in the matrix. If the user wants to terminate the program he can press 0 0 0. At the end the program shows the two matrixes as sparce (with the zeros) and shows a third matrix that is the sum of the two previous matrixes.
